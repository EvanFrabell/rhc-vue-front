      <h2>The RHC Standard</h2>
      <p>
        There are hundreds of variables that go into the valuation of a home for
        selling or buying. Let's simplify this for both you and your client by
        letting us do all the hardwork. At RHC we have created our own standard
        for valuing homes utilizing innovative algorithms and presenting them on
        an easily understood visuals. Every home receives an RHC Value® that your
        client can use to put them at ease while navigating the housing jungle.
      </p>
      <p>
        We only go off of tried and true methods when evaluating homes. These
        are our big 4:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Location</li>
        <li>Square Footage and Acreage (Weighted by Location)</li>
        <li>Current Market Rates</li>
        <li>Sale History</li>
      </ul>
